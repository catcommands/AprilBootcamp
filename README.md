## Primitive Data Types
- undefined
- null
- boolean
- string
- number
- symbol (in ES6)


In Javascript, primitive values do not have properties.



## Global vs Local Scope

## What is Global Scope?
Variable(s) which we see are defined outside function (or functions) are simply called 'Global Scope'

## What is Local Scope?
And off course, variable(s) which we define inside a function are called, 'Local Scope'.

### A simple straightforward explanation of Global vs Local Scope, [click here](https://github.com/JeffShah/AprilBootcamp/blob/master/W1D3/globalvslocal.js)

## Object literal in Javascript

JavaScript Object Literal. A JavaScript object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a tidy package. This minimizes the use of global variables which can cause problems when combining code.

## Modules in Javascript
In JavaScript, the word "modules" refers to small units of independent, reusable code. They are the foundation of many JavaScript design patterns and are critically necessary when building any non-trivial JavaScript-based application.



## JavaScript Style Guide
Read up to section 7 in the following JavaScript Style Guide. Make sure to bookmark this style guide and return to it whenever new concepts are introduced, or you are about to start on a new project.

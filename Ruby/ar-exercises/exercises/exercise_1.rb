Exercise 1: Create 3 stores
Use Active Record's create class method multiple times to create 3 stores in the database:
Burnaby (annual_revenue of 300000, carries men's and women's apparel)
Richmond (annual_revenue of 1260000 carries women's apparel only)
Gastown (annual_revenue of 190000 carries men's apparel only)
Output (puts) the number of the stores using ActiveRecord's count method, 
to ensure that there are three stores in the database.
